# Nuclear Terminology and Concepts

## Nuclear and Related Terms

- **Nuclear**: Pertains to the atomic nucleus. Pronounced "new-clear."
- **Nucleus**: The dense, positively charged core of an atom, composed of nucleons. (Plural: nuclei)
- **Nucleons**: Particles in the nucleus, including:
  - **Protons**: Positively charged particles.
  - **Neutrons**: Neutral particles.
- **Nuclides**: General term for isotopes of an element.
- **Isotopes**: Varieties of an element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

## Fundamental Forces and Stability

### Strong Nuclear Force
- Binds nucleons (protons and neutrons) together.
- Stronger than the electrical repulsion between protons but acts only at a short range (~10⁻¹⁵ m).
- Neighboring nucleons bind strongly; however, protons repel each other electrically over long ranges.

### Stable and Unstable Nuclei
- **Stable Nuclei**: Maintain equilibrium due to an optimal ratio of protons to neutrons.
  - Example: Beryllium-11 is more stable than Beryllium-10 due to a favorable neutron number.
  - Stable nuclei resist decay.
- **Unstable Nuclei**: Cannot maintain equilibrium and decay into more stable forms.
  - Radioactive nuclei decay due to neutron-proton imbalances.
  - Elements with atomic numbers greater than 83 (e.g., Bismuth-209) are inherently unstable.

## Atomic and Mass Numbers

### Atomic Number (Z)
- Represents the number of protons in a nucleus.
- Defines the identity of an element.
- Example: Carbon (Z = 6) always has 6 protons, whether neutral or ionized.

### Neutron Number (N)
- Indicates the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
- Neutron number varies among isotopes but does not change the chemical identity.

### Mass Number (A)
- Total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons).
- Formula: `A = Z + N`

## Isotopes and Their Properties

### Chemical and Physical Identity
- All isotopes of an element share chemical properties, as chemical behavior depends on electrons.
- Isotopes differ in physical mass due to varying neutron numbers.

### Isotopic Abundance
- The natural abundance of isotopes differs:
  - Common isotopes are more stable and widely found.
  - Rare isotopes occur in trace amounts, often discovered in controlled experiments.

### Example: Nitrogen Isotopes
- **Nitrogen-14**: 99.63% abundant, mass = 14.003074 u.
- **Nitrogen-15**: 0.368% abundant, calculated mass = 15.0001 u.

### Weighted Average Mass
- The periodic table lists the atomic mass as a weighted average of all naturally occurring isotopes.

### Nuclear Notation
- Standard representation: $^{A}_{Z}X$, where:
  - `A`: Mass number
  - `Z`: Atomic number
  - `X`: Element symbol
