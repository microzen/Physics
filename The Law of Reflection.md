The **Law of Reflection** states that when a light ray reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

The Law of Reflection is **always valid** within the framework of geometric optics, which treats light as rays traveling in straight lines. It applies to all types of surfaces—whether flat, curved, smooth, or rough—because it is based on the fundamental behavior of light at an interface.
- **Wave Optics:** When dealing with phenomena where the wavelength of light is comparable to surface features (like diffraction and interference), the simple Law of Reflection may not fully describe the behavior of light.
- **Quantum Effects:** At very small scales (atomic or subatomic levels), quantum mechanics governs light behavior, and classical laws like the Law of Reflection may not apply in the same way.

The Law of Reflection is valid for all surfaces because it applies **locally at each point on the surface**. Here’s why:
 - **Local Normals:** Every point on a surface has its own normal (a line perpendicular to the surface at that point). The Law of Reflection relates the incident and reflected rays to this local normal.
- **Surface Shape Irrelevance:** Whether the overall surface is flat, curved, or irregular doesn’t affect the local application of the law. Each interaction between a light ray and a point on the surface follows the law independently of other points.
- **Additive Effect:** The collective reflection from all these points results in the overall reflected light pattern, but the Law of Reflection governs each point’s contribution.
