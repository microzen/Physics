The mass of an individual atom or nucleus is called **atomic mass units (u)**. $$1u={1 \over 12} \text{ the mass of a } ^{12}_{6}{C} \text{ atom}$$
which means the mass of an C-12 isotope is 12.000000 u. The mass of all particles and the mass of all isotopes is always expressed in atomic mass units.

The atomic mass unit is a small amount of mass: $1u=1.660538782 \times 10^{-27}kg$.

# Mass-Energy Equivalency
$$E=mc^2$$
Belongs in the study of unclear physics, it means that the energy content of a certain mass $m$ is $mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Mass is regularly exchanged for energy during unclear reactions.
- E: how much energy it transforms into.
- m: if this much mass completely transforms itself into energy, in the other words, mass disappears puff gone. No longer in this world, it ceases to exist. but it gets replaced by some energy.

### During nuclear reaction
- Mass does not need to be conserved, it is common to end a reaction with less mass that when the reaction stated.
- Energy does not need to be conserved, it is common to end a reaction with more energy than when the reaction started.
During nuclear reactions, we require that the mass-energy equivalency be conserved.

### The Mass-Energy of 1u
$$E=mc^2=1u*c^2$$
$$=1.49241783\times 10^{-10}joule$$
It is an exceedingly small number in joules. Tiny amount of mass can only transform itself into a tiny amount of energy.

For **electron-volts**: Each $1u$ of mass can transform itself into $931.5MeV$ of energy. This is an exceptionally large number in $eV$. $1eV$ is a lot less energy than a joule.

# Examples

Q: How much mass-energy is stored in a 3-kg object?
A: $E=mc^2, \text{where }c=3*10^8$. $E=3\times (3\times 10^8)^2 = 2.7\times 10^17J$.
