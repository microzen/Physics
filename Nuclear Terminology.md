# The Atomic Number

The atomic number, $Z$, represent the number of **PROTONS** in a nucleus, and the number of protons gives an atom its identity. 

The [Periodic Table](obsidian://open?vault=Documents&file=Attachments%2FPeriodic%20Table%20of%20the%20Elements.png) lists elements in order by atomic number, that can be find in a periodic table's index. For example, a **Carbon** has $Z=6$ and **Oxygen** $Z=8$ , means any **Carbon** atom must have 6 protons in its nucleus and any **Oxygen** atom must have 8 protons in its nucleus.

If there is a way to add a proton to a nucleus of Carbon, it will turn into nitrogen. In a neutral atom, the atomic number is also the number of electrons. In the other word, the number of electrons can vary without change the identity of an atom. 

For example:
- Neutral Oxygen ($O$) has 8 protons and 8 electrons.
- Ionic Oxygen ($O^{2-}$) has 8 protons and 10 electrons.
In this case, it is still oxygen by 8 protons. 
# The Neutron Number
The information of Neutron Number, $N$,  in an atom **CANNOT** be found in the [Periodic Table](obsidian://open?vault=Documents&file=Attachments%2FPeriodic%20Table%20of%20the%20Elements.png) because the number of neutrons can vary. However, the information could be found in a Nuclide Tables, that are huge because each of the elements in the periodic table can be found in many varieties with different number of neutrons, which called the **[[#The Isotopic Mass|ISOTOPIC]]** of the element. The collection of all the isotopes of an element is called the **FAMILY** of the element.

> [!Info] Family members
> All family members have the same number of **protons**.

For example, a Nuclide Table for the Carbon family has different neutron number but same atomic number of protons.
# The Mass Number
The mass number, $A$, is the total number of particles in a nucleus, which count of number of protons and number of neutrons in a isotope: $$A=Z+N$$ Equation of the number of neutrons: $$N=A-Z$$
For example, in the **Carbon** family, **Carbon-15** has 15 mass number. $N=A-Z=15-6=9$, so it has 9 neutrons($N$).
# The Isotopic Mass
Isotopes are chemically identical. All members of a family have the same chemical properties, can form the same chemical compounds and react in the same way with other elements.

There is no chemical reaction that can let you distinguish one isotope from another, because the neutrons are not involved in chemical reactions. Therefore, Isotopes can only be distinguished by mass. The difference in number of neutrons makes the isotopes of a family have different atomic masses.

# The Isotopic Abundance
Not all isotopes of a family have the same abundance in nature. There are 3 passable in the same abundance in nature.
- Some isotopes are more common than others.
- Some isotopes are very rare and appear in the family table just because somebody in a lab somewhere actually found one.
- Every family has one member that is the most common, most abundant isotope, what we call the "normal, everyday" form of that element.

The atomic mass in the Periodic Table is the weighted average, of the mass of the isotopes.

>If you need the mass of an isotope, **NEVER** go to a Periodic Table to find it.

# Nuclear Notation
The nucleus of an isotope is written $^{A}_{Z}X$ where A is the mass number, Z is the atomic number, and X is the symbol for the element (the fa)

Question:

Nitrogen has two natural isotopes, N-14 and N-15.

Nitrogen-14 is the common, most abundant nitrogen. This isotope has a mass of 14.003074 u and a natural percent abundance of 99.63%.

Nitrogen-15 is rare, with only 0.368% natural abundance.

In the periodic table, the atomic mass of nitrogen is listed as 14.006463 u (the unit "u" of this number is called the "atomic mass unit," --> we will talk about this unit in class.)

Calculate what must be the mass of the N-15 isotope.
```

Atomic mass of N-14 = `14.003074`, its natural percent abundance is 99.63%. N-15 = ?, its natural percent abundance is 0.368%. The avg. mass of Nitrogen by abundance is `14.006463`. Therefore, 
$$(n14)(p14)+(n15)(p15)=M$$
$$\frac{M-(n14)(p14)}{p15}=n15$$
$$n15=\frac{14.006463-(14.003074)(0.9963)}{0.00368}=15.0001015761$$
