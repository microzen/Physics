# Transverse Waves
A **transverse wave** is a type of wave in which the oscillations or vibrations of the medium are perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction in which the wave travels. This perpendicular relationship distinguishes transverse waves from other types of waves, such as longitudinal waves, where the oscillations occur in the same direction as the wave’s propagation.

Visible Light is transverse wave.

# Transverse Waves vs. Longitudinal Waves
**Transverse Waves vs. Longitudinal Waves**: While transverse waves involve perpendicular oscillations, longitudinal waves involve parallel oscillations relative to the wave’s movement. Additionally, transverse waves can support shear stresses in the medium, whereas longitudinal waves involve compressions and expansions.

Sound is longitudinal wave
