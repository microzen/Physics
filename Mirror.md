![Eye-Mirror-Image Rule](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/collegephysics/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2016/04/Figure-26_02_06.jpg)
The smallest mirror required to see your entire body needs to be **at least half your height**. The top edge of the mirror must be at least **halfway between your eyes and the top of your head**. 

Everything in the **FRONT** side call **real** side, real light. Because this s a mirror, this must be in front. Everything in the **BLCK** side call **virtual** side, no light passes to back side.

# Flat Mirror
For a flat (plane) mirror, the object distance  $d_o$  (the distance of the object in front of the mirror) is equal to the image distance  $d_i$  (the distance of the image behind the mirror). Mathematically: $$d_i = d_o$$

### Real or Virtual
The image formed by a flat mirror is **virtual**. A virtual image is one that cannot be projected onto a screen because the light rays do not actually **converge** at the image’s location. Instead, the image appears to be located behind the mirror.
### Upright or Inverted
The image is **upright**. Unlike a lens or a curved mirror that can invert the image top-to-bottom, a flat mirror maintains the same vertical orientation. The image appears as if you are standing straight up; however, note that a plane mirror does produce a left-right reversal (lateral inversion). Despite this reversal, we still say the image is “upright” because it is not flipped upside-down.
### Enlarged, Reduced, or Neutral (Same Size)
The image formed by a plane mirror is the **same size** as the object. There is no magnification in terms of size change. Thus, the magnification  m  is 1 (neutral).

# Spherical Mirror
A spherical mirror is a mirror with a surface that forms part of the surface of a sphere.

A flat mirror could be a spherical mirror with $R \to \infty \text{ and }f \to \infty$. The Focal Point (F) given by: $$f=\frac{R}{2}$$
## Concave Mirror
A concave mirror is **convergent** because it focuses parallel incoming rays to a real focal point in front of the mirror. A **concave mirror** is considered the “==positive==” mirror. In the standard sign convention for spherical mirrors, a concave mirror has a **positive focal length**  f > 0. 

A **concave mirror** can produce a greatly enlarged image.
## Convex Mirror
A convex mirror is **divergent** because it causes parallel incoming rays to spread out as if they are emanating from a focal point behind the mirror. A **convex mirror** is considered the “==negative==” mirror. In the standard sign convention, a convex mirror has a **negative focal length**  f < 0 .

A **convex mirror** always produces virtual, upright, and diminished images regardless of where the object is placed (as long as it’s in front of the mirror)
