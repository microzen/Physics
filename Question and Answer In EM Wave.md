![Video: Static vs. Time-Variable Fields (8 min)](https://youtu.be/YxjGB2-oPsY)
1. What will make an electric field be independent of time? The source must stay static and not change its properties.
2. In a STATIC field, The field strength may be different at different locations, but each location retains its field strength without change.
3. In the first slide of the video, when talking about STATIC fields, what were the two types of sources of MAGNETIC fields shown? A bar magnet and a current-carrying wire
4. What happens to the field at your location if the source of the field moves closer to you? The strength of the field at your location will increase.
5. Could a magnet at rest ever produce a time-varying field? Yes, if the magnet itself is losing its magnetization (weakening) with time.
6. The coil with AC current (the electromagnet) was described as a good example of something that produces a magnetic field that varies in both position and time, without having to be in motion.
7. James Clerk Maxwell is considered The father of electromagnetic theory
8. According to the video, we will study "Maxwell's Equations" as a set of how many equations? 4
9. What are "Maxwell's Equations"? A complex mathematical work that explains electricity and magnetism.

1. Galileo is recognized for many things, but in the video I mentioned that one thing that made him unique is that...Galileo performed experiments to try to prove or disprove his ideas.
2. All that stuff that you learned in Phys 350 about motion and the laws of motion is OLD -- how old? It is from the 1600's.
3. What is the famous book written by Isaac Newton, where he summarized what today we call Newton's Laws? The Principia
4. What were the alchemists trying to do? Trying to convert common metals into gold.
5. What is the crowing achievement of the chemistry of the 1800's? The Periodic Table
6. Why do we think of the field of electricity as having sprouted out of chemistry?  Because the first batteries used oxidation-reduction reactions.
7. All the famous electric people: Volta, Gauss, Ohm, Ampere, Coulomb... they are from what time? From the 1700's.
8. What is Oersted's Discovery? That an electric current is also magnetic.
9. Why is Oersted's discovery significant? Because it was the first ever hint that electricity and magnetism are related.
10. What is Faraday's Discovery? That a magnet can be used to make electricity.
11. Who invented the steam engine? Mr. Watt
12. The steam engine and the discovery of EM induction are responsible for changing the way people live. Why? They resulted in the industrialization of the world.
13. If you look in the video at the names of the people associated with the field of thermodynamics, it appears that thermodynamics is the study of...energy
14. The field of optics, the study of light, has been around for very long. What was the main driving question in this field during the 1600's and all the way into the 1800's? What is light?
15. What did Newton think of light? He thought it has to be made of very tiny particles
16. From the historic perspective, when does Maxwell show up? At the end of the story -- with the advantage of all the previous work done.

![Maxwell's Equations](https://youtu.be/5HqS1yaZlwo)

1. Which set of equations tells us about the static electric and magnetic fields?
2. The fact that there are two sets of equations tells us that...The sources for static fields are different than the sources of time-variable fields.
3. What is the dot product $E\cdot dA$ called? electric flux
4. What is the dot product $B\cdot dA$ called? magnetic flux
5. The full expression for Gauss' Laws includes an integral with a circle on the integral sign. What does this mean? It means the formula is a calculation of total flux through a closed area.
6. What does the subscript $enc$ stand for in $q_{enc}$ ? It stands for enclosed -- "enclosed charge."
7. Why is $\oint \vec B\cdot d\vec A = 0$, always zero? Because magnetic field lines are closed loops.
8. Static electric charges produce static electric fields? TRUE
9. Static electric charges produce static magnetic fields? FALSE
10. A static electric charge cannot be a source of magnetic field? TRUE
11. Electric charges cannot be isolated? FALSE
12. There are no magnetic monopoles? TRUE
13. Magnetic field lines have no beginning and no end? TRUE

 ![Maxwell's Equations Part 2](https://youtu.be/dJB_8_Hj1Oc)
 1. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, a changing magnetic flux is a source for a time-varying electric field. Magnetic flux and electric field.
 2. The first part of Ampere-Maxwell's Equation, the part called Ampere's Law, says that...A current is a source of magnetic field.
 3. When the magnetic flux through a region of space (an area) changes, what appears in that region of space? A time-varying electric field.
 4. Which of the following summarizes the connection between Faraday's Induction and Maxwell's Induction? Time varying E(t) and B(t) fields induce each other.
 5. The magnetic field lines are closed loops. TRUE
 6. The electric field lines are closed loops. TRUE
 7. At all points E and B remain parallel to each other. FALSE
 8. The electric field lines have no beginning and no end. TRUE
 9. The plane of the B-field lines is perpendicular to the plane of the E-field lines. TRUE
 10. One of the most important aspects of Maxwell's work is the theoretical prediction that E(t) and B(t) will propagate together through space. What does "propagate" mean in the context of Maxwell's equations? It means to travel from one place to another
 11. One of the predictions (theoretical) of Maxwell's equations is that...We should be able to detect E(t) and B(t) even from a distance away from their source.
 12. One of the great mathematical achievements of Maxwell's work is the demonstration that...The variations in E and B propagate through space as a sinusoidal wave.
 13. Consider a source of varying magnetic field, like for example an AC coil. Consider point A a distance away from the coil. According to Maxwell's theory, if at one instant the electric field at A is $|E_A|$ , then at a later instant....the field will not necessarily be the same magnitude $|E_A|$.
 14. Consider a source of varying magnetic field, like for example an AC coil. Consider point A a distance away from the coil. According to Maxwell's theory, if at one instant the electric field at A is decreasing, then. the magnetic field that exists at A is...also decreasing.
 15. Consider a source of varying magnetic field, like for example an AC coil. Consider two points a distance away from the coil, point A close to the coil and point B farther away. According to Maxwell's theory, if at one instant the electric field at A is  $|E_A|$, then at that same instant...an electric field also exists at B, but it is not necessarily the same magnitude at that same moment.
 16. The speed of all waves, like waves on string, or sound waves on air, is determined by...the conditions of the medium through which the wave travels.
 17. The speed of an electromagnetic wave traveling through a material depends on what properties of the material? The permittivity and the permeability of the material.
 18. Can an electromagnetic wave travel through empty space? YES
