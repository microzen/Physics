Any [[Waves#Transverse Waves|transversal wave]], such visible light, can be selectively polarized. There are 2 types of light polarizations, **Unpolarized light** and **Polarized light**.

>  **Longitudinal waves**, such as sound, **cannot** be selectively polarized. Only for **Transversal** waves.

Any **transverse wave** (a wave in which the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation) can be polarized. Examples include:
- **Other Electromagnetic Waves:** Radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays can all be polarized.
 - **Mechanical Transverse Waves:** Waves on a string or certain seismic S-waves can also have polarization states.

# Polarization of EM 
The direction of polarization of a [[Electromagnetic Waves|EM wave]] is the direction of oscillation of the electric field (E-field) vector, always perpendicular to the propagation.

An ordinary beam of light consists of **MANY** EM-waves, that originate from vibrations of electrons at the source. The beam contains EM-waves in all possible directions of polarization.

**Transmitted Intensity:** When **unpolarized light** encounters an ideal linear polarizer, the transmitted intensity is reduced to **half** of the incident intensity. Mathematically, if the initial intensity is  $I_0$ , the transmitted intensity is  $I = \frac{I_0}{2}$.
## Polaroid Filters 
Polaroid filters were invented by Edwin Land in 1938
### Unpolarized Light
**Transmitted Intensity:** When **unpolarized light** encounters an ideal linear polarizer, the transmitted intensity is reduced to **half** of the incident intensity. Mathematically, if the initial intensity is  $I_0$ , the transmitted intensity is  $I = \frac{I_0}{2}$.

> [!note] **Unpolarized -> Polarized**
> $I=\frac{1}{2}I_0$

**Transmitted Direction of Polarization:** After passing through the polarizer, the transmitted light is now linearly polarized, and its polarization direction is aligned with the **polarization axis** of the polarizer.

### Polarized Light
**Transmitted Intensity:** If the light is already linearly polarized at some angle $\theta$ relative to the polarizer’s axis, the transmitted intensity follows **Malus’ Law**:

> [!note] **Malus' Law** (Polarized)
> $I = I_0 cos^2(𝜃)$

where  $I_0$  is the intensity of the incident polarized light and $\theta$ is the angle between the incident polarization direction and the polarizer’s axis.

**Transmitted Direction of Polarization:** The transmitted light remains linearly polarized, but now it is polarized along the **axis of the polarizer** regardless of the incident polarization direction.
