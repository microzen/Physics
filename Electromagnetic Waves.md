The electric field (E) and the magnetic field oscillate **perpendicular** to each other. This orthogonal relationship makes electromagnetic waves **transverse** waves.
# Electromagnetic Spectrum
![Electromagnetic Spectrum](https://hubblesite.org/files/live/sites/hubble/files/home/resource-gallery/articles/_images/JWST-EMS-Graphic.jpg)
All other EM waves outside the visible range, including Infrared (IR) more than 700 nm, Ultraviolet (UV) less than 400 nm, Radio, Microwaves, X-rays, and Gamma rays.
### The Colors of Visible Light
| Color: | Range of Wavelengths: | Range of Photon Energies: |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Violet | 400 to 450 nm         | 3.100 to 2.756 eV         |
| Blue   | 451 to 495 nm         | 2.749 to 2.505 eV         |
| Green  | 496 to 569 nm         | 2.500 to 2.179 eV         |
| Yellow | 570 to 590 nm         | 2.175 to 2.102 eV         |
| Orange | 591 to 620 nm         | 2.098 to 2.000 eV         |
| Red    | 621 to 700 nm         | 1.997 to 1.771 eV         |
All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum: $$c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$$
The speed of EM waves in vacuum **does not** depend on the wavelength, frequency or whether the radiation is visible or not.

The fundamental equation for any wave is: $$c=\lambda f = \frac{E_{max}}{B_{max}}=\frac{E(t)}{B(t)}$$
