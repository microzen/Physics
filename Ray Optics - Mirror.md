# The Spherical Mirror

A flat mirror is a spherical mirror with $R \to \infty$ so $f \to \infty$

$$
\lim_{f \to \infty} \frac{1}{f} = 0
,\frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = 0
,d_i = -d_o
$$

There are 2 types of mirrors and lens: concave and convex 

## The Spherical Concave mirror

>$$f=\frac{R}{2}$$

Everything in the **FRONT** side call real side, real light. $+$ Because this s a mirror, this must be in front. 
Everything in the **BLCK** side call virtual side, no light passes to back side. 

This s a **convergent** mirror - Rays reflect "in," toward the optical axis.

> Convergent: this is called positive (by agreement) $+f$

The image will always on where the reflected rays geometrically meet.

## The spherical convex mirror
Convex mirrors are **Divergent** - rays reflect "out" away from the axis, the focal length $f$ is negative $(-f)$

You can only see a **virtual** image thought the convex mirror.
