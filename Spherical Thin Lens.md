A **spherical thin lens** is a lens made from a transparent material (such as glass or plastic) with two refracting surfaces, each of which is a segment of a sphere. Light **passes through** the lens, undergoing refraction at each surface. **Lenses do not need to have the same radius of curvature on both sides.**

## Bi-Convex Lens
Both surfaces are curved outward, like two domes placed base-to-base. It is thicker at the center than at the edges. A bi-convex lens is generally a **converging lens**. A **bi-convex (converging) lens** is called a “positive” lens because it has a **positive focal length**.

A **biconvex (converging) lens** can be used as a magnifying glass. A **biconvex (converging) lens** can produce a greatly enlarged, upright image if the object is placed **inside the focal length** of the lens.
## Bi-Concave Lens
Both surfaces are curved inward, resembling the shape of an hourglass. It is thinner at the center than at the edges. A bi-concave lens is a **diverging lens**. A **bi-concave (diverging) lens** is called a “negative” lens because it has a **negative focal length**. 

A **bi-concave (diverging) lens** only produces virtual, upright images for real objects placed in front of it, regardless of where the object is positioned.
