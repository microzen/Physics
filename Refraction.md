**Refraction** is the phenomenon where light changes direction as it passes from one transparent medium into another with a different optical density (index of refraction). This bending occurs because light travels at ==different speeds== in different media. When a light ray enters a new medium at an angle (other than perpendicular to the surface), the change in speed causes the light to bend either towards or away from the normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the interface at the point of incidence).

>No change in the same material, but it will be **deflected** in a different material.

The ray always bends "closer to the normal line" when passing into a medium of **higher index** of refraction, light travels slower in the high $n$ material. However, $\theta$ is smaller in the medium of higher $n$. 

A ray bends **towards the normal** when It passes from a medium with a **lower index of refraction** to a medium with a **higher index of refraction** $( n_1 < n_2 )$.

# The Index of Refraction

The bending of light when it passes from one medium to another. 
- Light travels the fastest in a **vacuum**, $c=3.00*10^8 m/s$.
- Light travels slower than c when passing through matter, $v_{in material} \lt c$; therefore, the index of refraction is always **great than 1**.

The refraction causes light to change the direction of propagation -> effect of a change in wavelength. $v=\lambda f$ 
 Example: $$f = \frac{v}{\lambda}= 12 Hz = \frac{12m/s}{1m} = \frac{6m/s}{0.5m}=\frac{4m/s}{1/3m}$$ as $v$ decreases, $\lambda$ also decreases.

As any other wave, transferring to a different medium changes $v$, but preserves the frequency f.

 For light: $$f=\frac{c}{\lambda_0}=\frac{1c\over2}{1c\over2\lambda_0}=\frac{1c\over3}{1c\over3\lambda_0}$$$$n=1,n=2,n=3$$
> [!note] The Index of Refraction:
> The **index of refraction** ( n ) of a material is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum ( c ) to the speed of light in the material ( v ):
> $$n=\frac{c}{v} = \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}$$


# Snell's Law of Refraction
$${sin\theta_1\over sin\theta_2} = \text{constant for a pair of materials}={v_1 \over v_2} = {c/n_1 \over c/n_2} = {n_2 \over n_1}$$
$$n={c\over v}, v={c \over n}$$
Therefore:

> $$n_1sin\theta_1 = n_2sin\theta_2$$
> *$\theta_1 \text{ and } \theta_2$ always measure to normal, never to the interface.*
