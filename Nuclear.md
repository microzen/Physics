# Terminology
- **Nuclear**: Anything that has to do with the atomic nucleus. Pronunciation is closest to "new-clear"
- **Nucleus**: The positive + massive center of an atom. The plural of nucleus is nuclei
- **Nucleons**: The particles in the nucleus. There are 2 types: protons and neutrons.
	- **Protons**: Positively charged particles.
	- **Neutrons**: Neutral particles.
- **Nuclides**: General term for any group of isotopes.
- **Isotopes**: Varieties of an element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
## Strong Nuclear Force
This is the force that binds nucleons. It connect protons and neutrons. It competes with the electric repulsion between protons. It does not depend on charge. It has a very short range, no more than $10^{-15}$ m. (Nucleons have to essentially)
- Within this range, it is stronger than the coulomb electrical repulsion between protons.
- Neutrons and protons bind only with their immediate neighbors.
- But all protons (near and far) repel each other electrically.

[[Nuclear Terminology#The Isotopic Abundance]]
For the ISOTOPE TABLES, list starts with a neutron.

The more protons, the more neutrons are needed to hold the nucleus together.

Example: B-10 has 5 protons and 5 neutrons 20%. B-11 has 5 protons and 5 neutrons 80%. More abundant, B-11, is also the most stable. Magic N = 6.
### Stable Nuclei
Stable: It can restore itself (or recover) from a small disturbance.

A nucleus is Stable if the number of neutrons is just perfect to hold all the protons in place, against the electric repulsion. Families can have more then one stable isotope but each family has a magic number N that produces its most stable isotope.

Once formed a stable nucleus is very hard to destroy. All particles in the nucleus are strongly bound - it exists forever.
### Unstable Nuclei
Unstable: it will not restore itself even from a small disturbance.

If the number of protons and neutrons is not correct for stability (N is not magic), the nucleus exists in Unstable equilibrium. All families have many unstable isotopes. they have N > magic or N < Magic.

All unstable nuclei eventually **decay** (fall apart). This makes them less abundant than the more stable siblings. Unstable nuclei are called: **Radioactive** nuclei.

There are about 284 naturally occurring stable nuclei. All others are radioactive. Nuclei with Z > **(Bismuth)** 83 are **unstable**.

Bismuth-209, with 83p and 126n is the heaviest stable isotope.

### The Binding Energy Chart
Low BE means easier to break apart. High BE harder to break apart, more stability.

# The Modes of Decay
### Alpha Decay
1. **Instability**: Alpha decay only happens in isotopes with too much mass. Only observed in isotopes with Z > 83.
2. **Process**: the unstable nucleus ejects a group of (2p + 2n) still bound. Protons(alpha particle with positive charge) ejected with a high speed. The **remainder particles** can not bind in a more stable configuration with recoiling low speed. Identical to a nucleus of $^4_2He$. X has no KE, Y has some KE, and the ejected alpha has heigh KE.
3. **Reaction**: $^A_Z X_{parent} \to ^4_2He_{ejected}+^{A-4}_{Z-2} Y_{daughter}$. This is a transmutation, a change in identity.
4. Periodic table, $X\to Y,Z-2$
5. Binding Energy Chart: Rn is the daughter of Ra, Ra is 86 and Ra is 88, the identity is changed.
6. Mass requirement: All decay processes make energy ("exoergic" reactions). For alpha decay: $M_X \gt M_{products}$ and $M_X \gt (M_{\alpha}+M_Y)$ 
   Disintegration energy:
	- KE of ejected particles
	- KE of the daughter.
	- BE of the daughter.
7. Disintegration Energy: This the energy released during the decay event. $E=(\Delta M)C^2 = (M_x-M_{products})*C^2$, comes out mostly as KE of the ejected alpha particle.

### The Beta-Minus Process
1. Instability: N > magic, too many neutrons.
2. Process: One of the neutrons turns itself into a proton. As a result, two particles are ejected. 
	1. The Beta-Minus particle, that is identical to an electron.
	2. The anti-neutrino, that is a very small, neutral piece of matter.
3. Reaction: $^A_Z X_{parent} \beta^- \to ^A_{z+1}Y_{daughter} + ^{0}_{-1}e_{ejected} + \bar v$. where `e` is electron called **beta-mins particle**.
4. Periodic Table: $X\to Y,Z+1$
5. Binding Energy Chart: Y is more stable than X because Y higher than X.
6. Mass Requirement Disintegration Energy: $M_X>M_Y, (M_X-M_Y)*C^2$, converted to energy, mostly as KE of $\beta^-$ particle.

The Process:
- Neutrons and protons are made of smaller particles called Quarks.
- The quarks are bound by the weak nuclear force.
- Internally, the $\beta$ process involves a rearrangement of the quarks.
$$n\to p+e+\bar v, \text{ e and v are ejected}$$
### The Beta-Plus and EC
They are both responses to the same instability.
1. Instability: N < magic not enough neutrons that candidates for both $\beta^+$ and EC.
2. Processes: Both processes have the goal of making a neutron. $n\to p+e+\bar v$ a proton needs to find the equivalent to an electron mass and charge to build a neutron.
	1. $\beta^+$ process, Internally, by rearrangement of quarks, one proton turns itself into a neutron. This results in the ejection of 2 particles.
		1. The beta-plus particle, that is identical to an electron but it is positive.
		2. A neutrino.
3. Reaction: $^A_Z X \to \beta^+ \to ^A_{Z-1} Y + ^0_{+1} e + \bar v$, e is the positron ($\beta^+$ particle).
4. EC Process (Electron Capture): The nucleus absorbs one of the orbital electrons, and uses it to complete the conversion $p\to n$.
5. Reaction: $^A_Z X + ^0_{-1}e \to ^A_{Z-1}Y+ \bar v$.
6. Mass Requirements: Both are $M_X>M_Y$. but $\beta^+$ has an extra requirement: $M_X-M_Y \ge 2m_e$.
